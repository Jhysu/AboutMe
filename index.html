    <h1>Hello! I'm Kevin Tirta</h1>
    <p>I am a Mechanical engineering and Computer science (security) student in my third year of study</p>
    <p>soo around the world Huh?</p>

    <p>This is a bit about me and my journey of learning how to build a website as well</p>
    <p>Please take the time to look around this as much as you can (if you have the time) I have never done this before and it has taken me a very long time to make</p>
    <p>My first ever image will be below this line of text</p>

    <p>okay wait hodl on the process of getting a personal image on the website is wayy harder than I thought this tutorial on stack overflow will clutch up tho</p>
    <p>forgive the image I only have a laptop and a dream.</p>

    <p id="Japan" style="display: none;">Its currently 1:45am in Japan on the 13th of Feb I am around the world right now coding this up with 0 experience after a day of hitting the slopes and running around for food. Is that a good interpretation of around the world</p>
    <p id="Vietnam" style="display: none;">My oh my, possibly my favourite holiday destination ever, the food, the people, the memories. I owe this country another visit and have many stories to tell</p>
    <p id="Indonesia" style="display: none;">Indonesia, my blood runs red and white despite being born in Australia. Many times I have visited multiple cities of this nation, seen the traps and the castles and everything in between. <br>
         I can sort of speak the language and many of my extended family still live here</p>
    <p id="HongKong" style="display: none;">Hong Kong. Not much to say, I went here on a holiday when I was little and I dont remember a whole lot. <br>
        Dont want to seem ungrateful though travelling is a blessing and the fact that I even had the opportunity to have done so is something many others around teh world have not been able to</p>
    <p id="Singapore" style="display: none;"> Good cheap food, I have a tale of how I nearly got stuck in the country illegally for three days on my way to Vietnam. This was definetely one of the worst moments in my life</p>
    <p id="WestPapua" style="display: none;">I have not been here yet but will be in a couple weeks. In my life God comes first. He has provided everything for me, soon I am heading to West Papua to help those less fortunate at some orphanages, villages and churches. Ill make mistakes sometimesin life but Jesus got my back. </p>
    <p id="Perth" style="display: none;">Perth: Perrrrrtththhhhhhh <br>
        Perth is my home town, I grew up in Perth. Went to Primary and Highschool there as well as meeting some of the greatest people of all time <br>
        Back at home I used to have hobbies of playing high level sport and I used to make wooden furniture for fun<br>>
        Greatest city of all time, it is so peaceful, no tolls and you can really jsut do what you want when you want.</p>
    <p id="Sydney" style="display: none;">Moved to Sydney by myself to go and study at UNSW, I live in an apartment in maroubra and this city has really been amazing <br>
        I spend many days working for the airports, I enjoy what I do and I get paid, and thus I can survive hahahaha. however in the theme of around the world, the money that Ive been able to save has been able to let me travel. <br>
        I have joined many communities and made friends with so many different people of different ages in different settings <br>
        currently in uni I have done the courses: comp1511 comp1521 comp1531 comp2511 comp2521 math1141 math1231 phys1131 elec1111 engg1300 mman1130 desn1000 desn2000 math2018 engg2400 engg2500 mman2300 math2089 <br>
        I was in digisoc hr last year that was pre chill and attended cbs as well as social sport at uni, Im not at uni often because of work but I fit as much as possible in the time I am in <br>
        I'm excited to see where the next 3 and a bit years of my life in sydney lead me. </p>
    <p id="NewZealand" style="display: none;">I have not been here yet. I want to travel here this year if I get the time and the funds to meet one of my best friends but we shall see</p>



    <h2>okay time to insert buttons</h2>
    <p>but before that, a bit more about me</p>
    <p>I love soccer and basketball and I also watch them a lot</p>
    <p>I also love music, I used to play in a band as a drummer and I was in orchestras however I also like to pick up other instruments and listen to a bunch of music</p>
    <p>Hard coding is great... however now I will figure out how to hide my button outputs so it doesnt stack up.this part took so long </p>

    <h2> Adding pictures?</h2>
